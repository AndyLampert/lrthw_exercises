1. [.flatten](http://apidock.com/ruby/Array/flatten) - a method that I recently learned that will bring any recursive 
arrays up to the root array. 
2. [.uniq](http://apidock.com/ruby/Array/uniq) - a method that I recently learned that will return 1 instance of each
 value in the array, even if it is repeated.
