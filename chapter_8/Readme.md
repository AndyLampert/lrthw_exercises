**Q) Do you like string interpolation or format strings?  Why?**

I found this really confusing, so for now I prefer interpolation, but I'm definitely going to try and get myself comfortable with format strings.

I had a bunch on this one. Firstly, I used sublime for this exercise (sorry!), as using a new text editor slows me down bigtime and I'm getting pretty behind on the homework. 

The first problem was that I had hard tabs, so I fixed that by selecting the whole script and changing tabs to spaces. 

The next problem I had was trailing white space. After each comma and curly brace, I had an extra white space. Fixing those took out about 15 errors. 

As always, Guard got mad about the double quotes, so I changed those to single. And that took care of it!
