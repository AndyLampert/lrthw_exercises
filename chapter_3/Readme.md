I had 11 offenses this time. I learned that it's ok to use double-quotes if you are computing a value in the string. 

The other errors were from my comments being too long, so I shortened them, and that was it!

I first submitted this 6 days ago so I honestly don't remember. I will say that when I discover a new method, the first thing I typically do is fire up irb to test it out. I'll play with the new method, compare it to other methods, and see how it works.

As for floating numbers, I learned that if you add an integar and a floating number together it will return a floating point value. Interestingly, as long as they have the same value, comparing an integar and floating pointing returns true.
