**What are the three most essential skills that a beginner programmer needs to know?**

1. Reading and Writing
2. Attention to Detail
3. Spotting Differences

> Please explain these three skills in your own words.

**Reading and Writing**

is essential in daily life in any society. The two skills coincide with being able to understand something being 
communicated to you and being able to communicate your own thoughts.

**Attention to Detail**

is the skill to take in a spec from a client and really understand it. It's also being able to articulate yourelf in 
the way that you really mean to. It's about using correct grammar and being punctual. It's about checking your work 
before you submit it as well as ensuring you make as few mistakes as possible along the way.  

**Spotting Differences**

is the ability to recognize patterns in code and quickly spot the problems. I remember being stuck on something at my last bootcamp and finally asking the teacher for help. He looked at it for 5 seconds and told me I was missing a `</div>` somewhere. I thought he had super powers at the time, but now I'm also able to quickly debug HTML (though not quite that fast... ). 

**Why do you need to not copy and paste?**

Typing is important because typing is what you do as a web developer. Just looking at the code is also not enough to learn it, you have to do it by yourself if you ever hope to do it at all.

**Why is Practice and Persistence important?**

Because everybody has a hard time with learning a new skill and the only way to get better is to practice and persist. Zed argues that there's a point where you'll just "get it", but you have to force yourself to practice dilligantly regularly before that will happen.
