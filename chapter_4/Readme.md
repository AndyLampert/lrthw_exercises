### Study Drills

Zed got the undefined local variable error message because he tried to use a variable without defining it first. 

For example...

```
people = 5
puts "We have #{people} but only #{cars} cars.
```

will give the same error because we have not defined the variable cars.

1. It's not necessary to use 4.0. If you just use 4, then the calculated value later will also not have any decimal 
places (it will be a Fixnum, not a Float.)

3. Roger!
4. `=` is a setter. `cars = 4` is setting a variable `cars` equal to `4`.
