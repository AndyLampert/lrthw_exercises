### Study Drills

**2. Find all the places where a string is put inside a string. There are four places.**

- line 5
- line 10
- line 11
- line 21

**3. Are you sure there are only four places? How do you know? Maybe I like lying.**

I'm thinking that the 4 lines that I wrote above are the places that Zed puts a variable that computes into a string, where as to be technical, any puts statement that is passed a string could also be argued as a string withing a string... I think? 

**4. Explain why adding the two strings w and e with + makes a longer string.**

It makes a longer string because of string concatenation. It's printing out the value of w and then the value of e, making a longer sentence. 

### Rubocop offenses
This time my only problems were double-quotes where they weren't needed. As always, I highlighted the whole statement and hit the single-quote (`'`).
